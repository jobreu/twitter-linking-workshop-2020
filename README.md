# Interactive notebooks for the workshop [Linking Twitter &amp; Survey Data](https://training.gesis.org/?site=pDetails&child=full&pID=0x50AFEB41D3B34A09A1F067452267DFC5)

This repository contains a set of interactive [*Jupyter Notebooks*](https://jupyter.org/) to accompany the part on *Twitter* data collection in the workshop [*Linking Twitter &amp; Survey Data*](https://training.gesis.org/?site=pDetails&child=full&pID=0x50AFEB41D3B34A09A1F067452267DFC5).

If you have not worked with *Jupyter Notebooks* before, the most important thing to know is that you can run code cells by simply selecting them and clicking on the Play Symbol button in the menu at the top of the notebook. You can open files by double-clicking them in the explorer view on the lefthand side. You can download files to save them locally by right-clicking on the respective file in the explorer and selecting "Download".

If you want to learn more about *Jupyter Notebooks*, including how you can run and create them locally, there are many tutorials available on the web. A good starting point is the one by [Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/). 

This [*Medium* post by *Towards Data Science*](https://towardsdatascience.com/jypyter-notebook-shortcuts-bf0101a98330) provides an overview of helpful keyboard shortcuts for *Jupyter Notebooks*.

If you have worked with *Jupyter Notebooks* before, you might want to know that the [*GESIS Notebooks*](https://notebooks.gesis.org/) project for this workshop uses [*Jupyter Lab*](https://towardsdatascience.com/jupyter-lab-evolution-of-the-jupyter-notebook-5297cacde6b) and [*Binder*](https://mybinder.org/).

**To access the interactive notebooks simply click the "Launch Binder" button below**

[![Binder](https://notebooks.gesis.org/binder/badge.svg)](https://notebooks.gesis.org/binder/v2/gh/gesiscss/gesis_dataday_20/master?urlpath=lab)

Clicking the button will open a website in your browser with interactive *Jupyter Notebooks* that allow you to try out the [*rtweet*](http://rtweet.info/) package for `R` and the [*tweepy*](https://www.tweepy.org/), [*GetOldTweets3*](https://pypi.org/project/GetOldTweets3/) and [*twint*](https://github.com/twintproject/twint) libraries for `Python` without the need to install anything on your own computer.  

**NB**: This *GESIS Notebook* project is only meant for demonstration purposes. It should not be used for actually collecting data. If you want to use (code from) the notebooks to collect your own data, please download the notebook(s) and run them locally on your machine (or your own server).
